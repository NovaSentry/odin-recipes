    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A quick and easy gluten free (GF) pancake recipe</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>125g GF plain flour</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>250ml milk</li>
        <li>butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put the flour in a bowl and make a well in the centre</i>
        <li>Crack the egg in the well and pour in a quarter of the milk</li>
        <li>Use an electric  balloon whisk to thoroughly combine the mixture</li>
        <li>Once you have a paste, mix in another quarter and once lump free, mix in the remaining milk</li>
        <li>Leave to rest for 20 mins. Stir again before using</li>
        <li>Heat a small non-stick frying pan with a knob of butter. When the butter starts to foam, pour a small amount of the mixture into the pan and swirl around to coat the base â€“ you want a thin layer</li>
        <li>Cook for a few mins until golden brown on the bottom, then turn over and cook until golden on the the other side</li>
        <li>Repeat until you have used all the mixture, stirring the mixture between pancakes and adding more butter for frying as necessary</li>
        <li>Serve with agave syrup and a squeeze or orange juice or a pancake filling of choice</li>
    </ol>
